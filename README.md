> "I break things so you don't have to. Also, I fix them... sometimes."

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm **Salma**, your friendly neighborhood backend developer, keeping things functional, scalable, and mildly chaotic – in the best way possible. When I'm not battling APIs or juggling databases, I’m probably trying to explain to someone why "it worked on my machine." 😅

## 🛠️ Skills & Expertise

### Languages:
- **PHP** – The love of my (developer) life 💕
- **JavaScript** (Node.js) – Occasionally I walk on the dark side 🌑
- **SQL** – Writing queries that may or may not destroy your entire database.

### Frameworks:
- **Laravel** – Crafting elegant code while pretending it’s not all magic under the hood 🪄
- **Express.js** – Because lightweight doesn’t mean light on features 🚀

### Databases:
- **MySQL** – Because data has to live somewhere 🏠
- **PostgreSQL** – When I want to pretend I’m fancier than I am 🎩

### Other:
- **REST APIs** – Turning the chaos of backend logic into beautiful, consumable data. Endpoints are my happy place.
- **Caching** – Redis? Memcached? Yes, please! Gotta keep it fast and furious ⚡.
- **Docker** – Deploying my code in a little container so I can pretend it works everywhere 🚢.
- **Linux** – I like to spend my free time in the terminal. (No, really.)

## 🏆 Fun Facts
- I can write **500 lines of code** without blinking, but will spend **2 hours** debating the perfect variable name.
- I’ve personally wrestled with bugs more times than I can count, and every time I emerge victorious (or at least that's what I tell myself).
- I've learned that "It works on my machine" is not always a valid excuse... but it should be!

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- **GraphQL** – Because REST APIs just aren’t enough anymore, apparently.
- **Kubernetes** – Who needs sleep when you can manage containers all day?
- **Event-driven architecture** – Making things more asynchronous because life isn’t hard enough already.

## 💼 What I Do
When I’m not trying to explain to people why the backend is the backbone of everything (seriously), I’m:
- Designing and optimizing databases (aka, playing Tetris with data).
- Building APIs that don’t break when you look at them funny.
- Ensuring security, because no one wants to be *that* person with the data breach headline.
